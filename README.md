# LoL Memory Card Game
My League-of-Legends-themed memory card game implemented in React. You can see the live demo [here](https://wechicken456.github.io/memory-game/).

I implemented this game to learn React, and it is my first React project.

Learned about states, updating states, mutations, audio, and side effects.
